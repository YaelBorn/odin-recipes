<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here's a fragrant, colorful fresh egg pasta that's infused with saffron. "Roll out in thin sheets with or without a pasta machine, then bake directly in a lasagna with bolognese or bechamel sauce, or make tagliatelle and serve with your favorite sauce," says Alemarsi. Watch the brief video to see how to make saffron pasta!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place flour on a marble or wooden work surface. Make a well in the center and crack in eggs; add salt. Gently beat eggs using a fork, incorporating the surrounding flour, until mixture is runny. Pull remaining flour into the center using a bench scraper, incorporating it until dough forms a ball.</li>
        <li>Knead dough with your hands by flattening the ball, stretching it, and folding the top towards the center. Turn 45 degrees and repeat until dough is soft and smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shape dough into a ball. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough with a pasta machine or with a rolling pin and cut into your favorite pasta.</li>
    </ol>
